This is a page dedicated to everything I owe, to everyone who has ever been kind, and to all the embarrassment I know.

I hate being vulnerable. In truth, I crave the ability to be vulnerable more than anything else, but when it comes down to the wire, I simply can't let go of all of the fear. I'm scared of embarrassment, scared of failing, scared of hurting people, and scared of being hurt by people. I'm trying to be brave for once, so here's where I'll give my thanks to everyone and everything that I can. If you somehow stumble across this, please let me pretend to be brave and know that I'll thank you for your kindness. This is everything I oweâ€”Rebecca Koleth
