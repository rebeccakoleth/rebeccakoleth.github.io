    Favourite Daughter
  </a> is a song on Lorde's new album, <em>Virgin</em>, which she released at midnight on June 27th, right after my birthday ended. The first time I listened to Favourite Daughter, I was perched on the surface of my vanity dresser, trying on a lip gloss I had bought during sophomore year with a friend. I wanted something to cull out the creaky sounds of the night, and Lorde popped up on my YouTube subscriptions. Normally, I exclusively listen to my music on Spotify, because I begged for Spotify Premium and I indulge in ad-free listening. First, I watched

  </a>, which is blue and feels like sticking your face into the ocean with your eyes wide open. There are splashes of glowing light across shadowed figures moving like pulses of energy in a plasma globe and filaments sparking in glass. The song feels that way, too.

Lorde's whispery lyrics and her desperate pace make her sound like she's constantly on the verge of tears and simultaneously filled with sharp anger. She's a daughter trying to honour her mother, outgrow her, return to her, and understand her in one lung-crushing breath. It's incredulous to her that her inherited dreams seem like anything more than "some kid fakin' it for your love." There is no escape from that self-eroding, aching love that both endears and traps her. Honestly, every lyric she writes is a grieving confession, so I can't leave it all in her words.

<div class= "indent">
Constantly fighting to earn love that should have been freely given, crushed under the weight of a debt of dreams ("breaking my back to carry the weight of your heart") under the premise of a better life. Becoming a smoother, subtler, kinder version of yourself, every move threatening to collapse the quietly architectured expectations. Watching biting anger once directed towards you turn towards others, and still dreading the day it finds its way back to you. Wishing they had been kinder to the little girl she once was, dreaming big and loud. Instead, every silence is a held breath. Love, when given with conditions, never feels like rest. It becomes a perpetual contortion that falls apart and washes away before reforming, each time more brittle. It looks easier, and for a while, it is easier to imagine this delicate love forever, but bravery isn't enough to forgive a mom who is always just out of reach. Forgiving the daughter she used to be is easy. She once confessed to me that I looked just like her sister, who died a few years ago, and she was embarrassed as she admitted she fleetingly believed in reincarnation.

Favourite Daughter is not female rage, or thought daughter core, or whatever people say on the internet. It's not even truly angry. It's tired and loving. It's love, worn thin.

I listened to Favourite Daughter 50 billion times while writing this, so this is one thing I owe to Lordeâ€”Rebecca Koleth
