title: Evil Cookie

This cookie definitely cursed me.

<div class= "indent"> Last night, or really, this morning, I baked a cookie. It was a recipe from Instagram with grand promises of crunchy edges and a soft, chewy centerâ€”I just had to make it. The whole process probably began around 1 am, which should have been the first warning. I kicked off my slippers and slinked around in my socks, trying to make as little noise as possible.</div>
<div class= "indent">First, gather the ingredients. I grabbed the butter from the shelf on the inside of the refrigerator door, slicing two tablespoons' worth of unsalted, sweet cream butter from the stick. I grabbed vanilla extract from the shelf on the inside of the other door, gingerly pinching the top to avoid the sticky, undried spill on the blue wrapper. In a stainless steel bowl, I combined all-purpose flour, light brown sugar, granulated white sugar, a pinch of salt, and a white substance that had a 25% chance of being baking soda. That baking soda (?) should have been my second warning. I melted the butter in the microwave, pressing the 'reset timer' button right as the timer hit 1 second. Everything mixed in the bowl, and an almost forgotten tablespoon of milk joined the concoction. At that point, I decided to refer back to the video, discovering that the consistency of my cookie dough was not quite right. I popped the bowl into the fridge to see if the cold would stiffen the dough up a bit, and I sat on the floor to wait. Fork, my lovely girl, sat on me. Eventually, I got tired of waiting. I've never been very good at waiting anyway. The dough went from the bowl to the baking sheet to the oven, and suddenly... I was pulling the tray out of the oven.</div> 
<div class= "indent"> <img src="/assets/evilcookie.png" alt=""> A cookie only a mother could love. But I didn't. I tried to eat it, but the butter coated my fingers and the crunchy edges were like peanut brittle. It was a bad cookie. Some may even say that it was an evil cookie.</div>
<div class= "indent"> There is zero doubt in my mind that this cookie cursed me. From the time I woke up to a sickening feeling of missing something I've never truly had, to this very moment, I've felt the effects. For lack of a better expression, I must say shit hit the fan. Bullet points today include my trip to the little Korean store in the neighbouring city, trying and failing to understand CNNs, writing in my journal, sitting through a rainy drive with my mom, and people screaming in the house.</div>
<div class= "indent"> I've always wanted a family. That's a pretty weird thing to say for a kid who grew up with both parents alongside two older siblings. Nevertheless, I've always wanted a family. I think evil cookie knew that. Just like my cookie, which bubbled strangely in the oven heat, my family is a crumbly, sad joke of a family. I have the same last name as my sister and dad, and my brother and my mom have a different last name, which doesn't seem so important at first, but somehow still hurts. I made my cookie in the middle of the night because I secretly like silence.</div>
<div class= "indent"> I crave a proper silence in this house full of screaming misconceptions and lies and people who have only ever learned how to hurt each other fatally. Can bad people hurt bad people? I worry that I'll end up as an evil cookie, or maybe in the midst of an evil cookie. I'm scared that the things I cling to aren't good either. There are words exchanged that I cannot repeat, but sometimes I start a voice memo recording and place it by the door, and I'm not sure why. Is it so that later I can analyse what went wrong, what my role in this mess was, and how I can make it about me? Evil cookie.</div>
<div class= "indent"> I want to write poetry, but shame encases my fingertips when I try to pick up the pencil. So, I just walk in silence. I walk out the door, through the broken gate, down the sidewalk. I wait for the cars to flash their lights, and I run across the road. It's only polite. I walk along the bridge, I peer over the railing, I look at the tracks. I walk faster and make my way into the store. It's perfect. If I could forget this town, move to a coastal town, and walk into a store like this, I would. If the mother holding her son's hand, flip-flops squeaking on the linoleum, grabbed two popsicles, paid at the counter, and walked out onto a steep street that eventually led to a gritty beach, I would start life over. I didn't buy cookies. My evil cookie haunted me. I'm awkward as I walk down the same aisle again and again. I'm too busy thinking about that mysterious baking soda and the menacing cookie that rose from it. I start the walk back with the sun burning the back of my neck and the side of my face.</div>
<div class= "indent"> It burns the same way shame burns because I shouldn't still be feeling hurt. I've learned that screaming is still painful, and the words claw at my throat on their way out. I don't know if I want to be heard, or be seen, or be read quietly in a nook. I'm not sure how to speak when there is no one to listen. 
<div class= "indent"> I want laughter and love and fond memories. I want a family full of good people who make mistakes occasionally and apologise for them. "I'm sorry." It's never said in this house. Wait until the wound scabs over and dig nails in again.</div>
<div class= "indent"> I want fear to be shared. I want people who apologise easily. I want flip-flops slapping against tile and the promise of waves on the sand. I want a childhood friend who knows me better than I know myself. I want trust. I want someone to help me when I bake an evil cookie, even if they laugh at me first.</div>
<div class= "indent"> I know I'm greedy, but when I feel most myself, I think of the future, and I am always gone in some way. The streetlights are dark, the world is quiet, and I open the door to a small house. I turn on a harsh, white light that doesn't reach the corners of the house. In all the futures I accept, I am alone. No one waits for me to come home.</div>
