I was born on a Thursday in the summer and named Rebecca Ann Koleth. Nobody calls me Rebecca, but I signed every assignment, essay, test, and email with Rebecca Koleth until high school. Becky is still new, and if I make a mistake here, I want it to be left with Rebecca, so I'll sign each post with Rebecca Koleth. 

I often say that the most interesting thing about me is my cat, Fork. She is lovely in every way, but I am searching for something interesting about me that is, well, actually about me. Here are some facts: my favourite colour is green, I like shrimp, and I don't go outside enough. If you feel like knowing more, you can read some of my posts to figure out whatever is wrong with me. That's all.
