I think about fear.


</div>

<div class=indent> Fear is a reaction. People's brains tend to either prompt them to stay and fight or run away. Everyone knows about the fight-or-flight response, and everyone has experienced the rush of adrenaline and cortisol as their body gears up to survive, but there are two less popularised responses: freeze or fawn.</div> <div class=indent> I feel fear so often it permeates my whole being with freezing hatred. Iâ€™ve felt fear so strong it has cut right into my flesh. I hate fear, and I am ashamed of feeling fear, and even more ashamed of hating fear.</div> <div class=indent> The walls of this house are not thin. I would know, because when I was younger I took a loose screw and carved a hole into the plaster wall next to my bed every night and by the time I was found out, it was only about an inch in depth and width. They asked why, because it wasn't necessarily typical behaviour for a little girl, and I didn't have much of an answer. I think I wanted to escape into a smaller place that I could call safe.
