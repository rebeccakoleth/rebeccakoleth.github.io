Hi, Katie. I'm planning on sending this to you.
</div>
<div class = "indent">  
We talk about music a lot. Almost every conversation eventually returns us to music, as if it exists as our most natural form of communication. Maybe music is a baseline we share. Even now, we send each other Spotify links, and we plan to frolic in fields while listening to Ravel's string quartet or Debussy's Prelude To The Afternoon Of A Faun. I can't wait to frolic with you.
</div>

<div class="indent"> 
You and I have had multiple conversations in which I claim that I don't like to listen to slow or sad music, but the truth is, I very much do like those types of songs. <em>I Can and I Will</em> by Searows is just one of many slow, sad songs that I find myself needing.
</div>

<div class="indent">
This song is bittersweet like nostalgia on an autumn night. It is sad, but it is also clearly hopeful, and I wanted that kind of hope. It feels like struggling to believe that things will get better, even as the arms around you offer a home and haul you up off the ground.
</div>

<div class="indent">
It's embarrassing to admit how lost I have been and how often. I figured being found meant finding happiness in everything, everywhere. When I hope for a future with all of you guys, I am truly a doomed optimist. In my optimistic utopia, sadness cannot permeate the swirling rainbow patterns of our little bubble. Of course, I know that pain and discomfort are part of living, and I know that happiness would grow stagnant without the raw moments, but I used to convince myself that a pristine life would fill my heart. 
</div>

<div class="indent"> 
I know nothing is guaranteed. I know that constantly searching for a meaning in a world where you must make your own produces absurdity. I think the meaning of life is whatever we are doing that prevents us from leaving. That's a thought stolen from Albert Camus.
</div>

<div class="indent"> 
I listened to this song over and over to make myself keep going towards a reality where I trust every lyric. To me, <em>I Can and I Will</em> is an acceptance of coexisting hurting and healing. I don't want to admit to liking sad songs because I don't like how they make me feel. I don't like bittersweet songs because I don't like to confess that I need to feel hope. 
</div>

<div class="indent">  
If you walk outside on a windy day with this song playing in your ears and the foliage rustling the ground beneath your feet and the cold, drizzly air clinging to your face, you might feel it. Every inhale will be soaked in the smell of autumn—not the wafting scent of pumpkin spice or new woollen scarves, but the sweet, peppery smell of decaying leaves. When the light gusts of air rush past your ears and you look up through a canopy of trees towards an empty, blue sky, with your chilled fingertips jammed into too-small pockets, I hope you feel like you can and you will.

For all the times I've tried to learn how to apologise to myself, and for everything I've tried to forget. This is a reminder that I Can and I Will. An imperfect addition and lesson in acceptance, this is one thing I owe to myself.—Rebecca Koleth
